# Rock Carrot

This is a Flutter App inspired by the great [YacGuide App](https://github.com/YacGroup/yacguide) for Android.

This is not intended to replace YacGuide, but to have the offline functionality of [DB Sandsteinklettern](http://db-sandsteinklettern.gipfelbuch.de/) for iOS.

This started as my first Mobile App. So it is rather basic and might miss architecture building blocks - but so far it works.

# Localisation
to compile the code you need to run "flutter gen-l10n" in the root
